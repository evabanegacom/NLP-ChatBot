Science is the systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation, experimentation, and the testing of theories against the evidence obtained

There are three main branches of science: physical science, earth science and life science. Each of the three branches of science has its own career applications.
Types: orthodox science or sensu stricto science, interpretations placed on observations, fiddling science, speculation and Polemic.

Modern science is typically divided into three major branchesty 
natural sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics), 
which study the physical world; the social sciences (e.g.,
 economics, psychology, and sociology), which study 
 individuals and societies;[15][16] and the formal sciences (e.g., logic, mathematics, and theoretical
  computer science), which study formal systems, governed by axioms and rules.
   There is disagreement whether the formal sciences are science disciplines,
   because they do not rely on empirical evidence.[22][20] Applied sciences are disciplines 
   that use scientific knowledge for practical purposes, 
such as in engineering and medicine.
